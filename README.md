# Simple Python Chatbot using NLTK

This is a basic chatbot built with Python's **NLTK** library.  
It uses simple pattern matching and predefined responses to simulate a conversation.

## Features
- Responds to greetings, personal questions, and basic small talk.
- Uses **regular expressions** for pattern matching.
- Easy to extend with more patterns and responses.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NLTK library

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chatbot.git
   cd chatbot
````

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install nltk
   ```

3. (Optional) Download the NLTK `punkt` tokenizer:

   ```bash
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt
   ```

## Usage

Run the chatbot:

```bash
python chatbot.py
```

Type your messages and the chatbot will respond.
To exit, type:

```
quit
```

## Example Conversation

```
Hi, I'm Chatbot and I'm a chatbot. Type 'quit' to exit.
> hello
Hello
> my name is John
Hello John, How are you today?
> quit
BBye take care. See you soon :)
```

## How It Works

* Patterns and responses are defined in `pairs` as regex-response lists.
* The chatbot uses `nltk.chat.util.Chat` for conversation handling.
* Reflection mappings from NLTK help in basic pronoun changes.

If you want, I can also make a **more polished GitHub-ready README** with badges, screenshots, and contribution guidelines. That would make your repo look professional.
